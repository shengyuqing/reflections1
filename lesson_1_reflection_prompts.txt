How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    感觉很方便，不用自己找bug，特别是文件很大的时候

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

不断定期的保存文件，然后使用diff来查找修改

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

可以让你知道什么时候可以保存，自己保存有优势。缺点是可能会搞忘记

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

可以方便查找，方便修改。因为有很多变量或者函数是相关的，修改一个文件，其它文件要跟着修改。 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

可以方便的查找历史中修改的内容，查找他们不同的内容，如果有一天要重新回到原来的地方可以跳转过去。

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

既然可以通过跳到过去的commit知道运行情况，那么就可以大胆的尝试新的想法，而且还能快速补救一些错误
